I had been exploring programming for a while, taking some introductory Python and JavaScript courses, when I read Matthew B. Crawford’s book [*Shop Class as Soulcraft: An Inquiry into the Value of Work*](https://www.amazon.com/Shop-Class-Soulcraft-Inquiry-Value/dp/0143117467). This quote really resonated with me:

> The satisfactions of manifesting oneself concretely in the world through manual competence have been known to make a man quiet and easy. They seem to relieve him of the felt need to offer chattering interpretations of himself to vindicate his worth. He can simply point: the building stands, the car now runs, the lights are on. 

I realized that I have that feeling when I am am programming. Even though programming is very much about abstraction, the act of programming, of building, testing and problem-solving, feels more tangible, satisfying and creative to me than work I have done in the past. I had the opportunity to work with developers on occasional projects at work, and I loved how collaborative and energizing it was. Eventually, I couldn’t escape the feeling that I had to be involved in that work all the time.

I chose the Flatiron School Online Web Developer Program because I can fit it in around my life, and the Flatiron School clearly has a commitment to diversity in tech, so I feel supported. Something that once didn’t seem doable is now accessible to me, and I’m so excited.
